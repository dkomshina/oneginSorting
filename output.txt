A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,
Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,
     And being low never reliev'd by any.
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud;
     And now his grief may be compared well
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
     And on they well-breath'd horse keep with they hounds.
     And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,
     And this I do to captivate the eye
"And when thou hast on food the purblind hare,
And whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
     Applying this to that, and so to so;
     Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:
     As if another chase were in the skies.
As if the dead the living should exceed;
     As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,
As who should say, 'Lo! thus my strength is tried;
     Beating his kind embracements with her heels.
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,
     Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.
Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,
"But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;
But, lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,
"By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
     Controlling what he was controlled with.
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
     Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:
Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,
Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
     Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.
     For love can comment upon every woe."
     For misery is trodden on by many,
For rich caparisons or trapping gay?
"For there his smell with other being mingled,
     For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,
     Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd.
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:
He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;
     He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.
He vails his tail that, like a falling plume
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
     His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,
His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say?'
     His love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
His testy master goeth about to take him;
How he outruns with winds, and with what care
     If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.
Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,
In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,
     In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone
     I prophesy they death, my living sorrow,
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
"Lie quietly, and hear a little more;
     Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
     Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.
     Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'
Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,
Or at the roe which no encounter dare:
     Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.
     Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,
Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
     Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
She answers him as if she knew his mind;
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
     Shows his hot courage and his high desire.
     So did this horse excel a common one,
Sometime her trots, as if he told the steps,
"Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,
Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;
     Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,
     The iron bit he crushes 'tween his teeth
     The many musits through the which he goes
     Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,
Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
"Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
     The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:
To bid the wind a race he now prepares,
To hearken if his foes pursue him still:
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,
     To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,
Turn, and return, indenting with the way;
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,
Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,
Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
What cares he now for curb of pricking spur?
What recketh he his rider's angry stir,
When lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
With gentle majesty and modest pride;
With her the horse, and left Adonis there.
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
