As if the dead the living should exceed;
In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,
As who should say, 'Lo! thus my strength is tried;
"For there his smell with other being mingled,
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
     His love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,
     Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd.
Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
She answers him as if she knew his mind;
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud;
A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:
With gentle majesty and modest pride;
Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,
     The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,
Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
     Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.
He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.
He vails his tail that, like a falling plume
"But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;
His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
     In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone
     So did this horse excel a common one,
     For love can comment upon every woe."
How he outruns with winds, and with what care
Or at the roe which no encounter dare:
"And when thou hast on food the purblind hare,
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,
With her the horse, and left Adonis there.
     His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,
     Shows his hot courage and his high desire.
"Lie quietly, and hear a little more;
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
     And this I do to captivate the eye
Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,
Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,
"Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
     The iron bit he crushes 'tween his teeth
     Controlling what he was controlled with.
     Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
     Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
     To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,
     And now his grief may be compared well
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,
"By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,
To hearken if his foes pursue him still:
     As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,
     Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
His testy master goeth about to take him;
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
     Applying this to that, and so to so;
"Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,
When lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,
     Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
     And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,
He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
And whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;
What recketh he his rider's angry stir,
What cares he now for curb of pricking spur?
Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,
     And on they well-breath'd horse keep with they hounds.
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
     Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.
     He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
     As if another chase were in the skies.
     Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles
     Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.
     The many musits through the which he goes
To bid the wind a race he now prepares,
Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;
     For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,
     Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.
     Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
     Beating his kind embracements with her heels.
     Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,
Sometime her trots, as if he told the steps,
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
     If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.
     I prophesy they death, my living sorrow,
For rich caparisons or trapping gay?
His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say?'
Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
Turn, and return, indenting with the way;
     Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'
But, lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,
     For misery is trodden on by many,
     And being low never reliev'd by any.
Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,
Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,
